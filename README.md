Traffic Light Intersection Simulation 

Hardware Required
To run this simulation you will need a computer with the the following specifications:
1.	15.6” screen with 1366x768 resolution. 
2.	i5-4210u 2.6GHz processor.
3.	NVidia Geforce 820M graphics card.
4.	8GB RAM.
5.	1GB free hdd space.

Software Required
The following software will also be necessary:
1.	Windows 8.1 64bit.
2.	JDK 8 64bit.

Running the Simulation
1.	Find the file named TrafficSim.jar and run it. A window will open.

2.	Enter the number of cars in the text fields labeled “Number of cars” manually 
	or use the buttons under the “Data Bounds:” label to load preset car values.

3.	Now run the simulation using the “New System” or “Existing System” buttons. 
	The “New System” button will switch the lights smartly while the 
	“Existing System” button will just follow its normal cycle without considering the number of cars.

4.	The “Stop” button will stop the simulation.

Simulation Outputs
The simulator will record and display the time it takes to complete a simulation. 
This value can be seen in the bottom right of the window mentioned above and it is updated after each run.
